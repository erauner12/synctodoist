# Welcome to SyncTodoist

SyncTodoist helps you interact with the Todoist Sync API v9 in Python. To find out more about the Todoist API, please, visit
[developer.todoist.com](https://developer.todoist.com).

## Design Principles

This package was designed with the following principles in mind:

1. **Pydantic everywhere**: Data is moved around as a Pydantic data model
2. **Match the Todoist REST API**:The API should follow the REST API as closely as possible, only deviating where it is necessary due to the different nature of
   the Sync API.
3. **Modern Python**: It follows modern Python design concepts, e.g. careful type annotation everywhere.
4. **Properly documented**: this documentation follows the Di√°taxis model.
5. **Thoroughly tested**: every part of the code is tested thoroughly with unit tests and integration tests
