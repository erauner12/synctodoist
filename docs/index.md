# Welcome to SyncTodoist

SyncTodoist helps you interact with the Todoist Sync API v9 in Python. To find out more about the Todoist API, please, visit
[developer.todoist.com](developer.todoist.com).

## Design Principles

This package was designed with the following principles in mind:

1. Data is moved around as a Pydantic data model
2. The API should follow the REST API as closely as possible, only deviating where it is necessary due to the different nature of the Sync API.
3. It follows modern Python design concepts, e.g. careful type annotation everywhere.
